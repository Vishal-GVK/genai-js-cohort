Custom Tokenizer
================


Steps to run the project:
1. Clone/Download the repository from 1.0 branch
2. Run `npm install` to install required dependency.
3. Run `npm start` to start the project.
4. Access the project on http://localhost:3000


Logic used:
Input text is broken down to each character which is then converted into corresponding ASCII value.


Usage:
1. User can input any text that has to be tokenized/encoded. This will be tokenized and then the encoded text is displayed.
2. User can then choose to detokenize/decode the encoded text. This will detokenize and then display plain text.
3. After detokenzing, the yielded text is compared with user input and will result whether the match is successful or not successful.
