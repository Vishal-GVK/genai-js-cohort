Usage:

2. User can then choose to detokenize/decode the encoded text. This will detokenize and display plain text.
3. After detokenzing, the yielded text is compared with user input and will result whether the match is successful or not successful.


Logic used:
Input text is broken down to each character which is then converted into corresponding ASCII value.
